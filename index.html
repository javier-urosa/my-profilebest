			<h2>Childhood</h2>
			<p>I was born in Madrid, Spain. I attended King's College Madrid since I was 3 years old and I graduated there before university. This gave me the opportunity of being completely fluent in a language which wasn't originally my mother tongue.</p>

			<h2>Family</h2>
				<p>Honestly, I think that my family is the biggest gift I could have ever asked for. Not only my parents and sister, but my cousins, uncles and grandma shape a beautiful family full of love and affection.</p>
